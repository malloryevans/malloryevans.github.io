### Abstract  
Stop and frisk is law enforcement’s practice of “temporarily detaining, questioning, and, at times, searching civilians on the street.”  Under New York Criminal Procedural Law 140.50, an NYPD officer may use this investigative technique when they reasonably suspect that a person has committed or will commit a crime. Since its implementation, its constitutionality has been questioned on the grounds of privacy rights, and more recently, the procedure has come under fire for its purported racial disparities and low success rates in recovering contraband and producing arrests.  

For our project, we would like to explore these issues and present evidence to support some of these controversial claims. Some of the major questions we want to ask are:  
- Who is targeted under stop and frisk (gender, age, race, etc.)?  
- For what reasons are people stopped and searched?  
- Where do stops most commonly occur in the city, and how does this relate to the economic and demographic composition of those areas?  
- How often is contraband like weapons or drugs recovered, and how often are arrests made?  
- How often do officers resort to use of force in detaining or searching a person?
